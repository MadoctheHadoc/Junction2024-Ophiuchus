## üìñ Overview
Iris automates equipment inventory with the framework of a digital solution that interprets labels of building machinery to take inventory with BIM integration

---

## üöÄ Features
- *Optical Character Recognition:* Reading text from images to eliminate eye-to-hand copying.
- *User-friendly App Design:* Easy to use app for non-experts to do inventory.
- *Natural Language Processing:* The output of the OCR has to be interpretted into usable inventory data.  
- *BIM Integration:* Created databases designed to work with BIM format allowing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Mention the languages, frameworks, APIs, and tools you used in this project.

*Example:*
- *Frontend:* React Native(TypeScript, JavaScript)
- *Backend:*  Flask (TypeScript, JavaScript)
- *Database:* MySQL
- *APIs:* google-cloud-documentai, 
- *Other Tools:* Expo SDK, Pillow

---

## üìê Architecture
Iris uses an *expo frontend* that communicates with a *Backend backend. The backend interacts with **MySQL for data storage* and integrates with external APIs for data on workouts and nutrition.

We use basic server-client architecture to facilitate communication between the API and the user via the app.

`PROJECT_ID=your-google-cloud-project-id 
LOCATION=your-documentai-location (e.g., us, eu)
PROCESSOR_ID=your-documentai-processor-id 
DB_USER=your-database-username
DB_PASSWORD=your-database-password 
DB_HOST=localhost 
DB_NAME=your-database-name 
DB_PORT=3306`

#### Set Up MySQL Database

Install MySQL and create a database with the name specified in the .env file (DB_NAME).
CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
